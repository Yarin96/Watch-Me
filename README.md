# Watch-Me

A fully responsive movie application developed with React.js and Node.js, while focusing on the frontend side.\
All of the data is fetched from a local JSON file and an external API called TMDB.\
Explore thousands of movies, watch trailers and make your very own favorites list!
* This project was made as part of an academic course.

* Note: The local JSON data isn't visible after deployment.\
  As a result the Genre section won't load. Issue will be fixed in the future.
