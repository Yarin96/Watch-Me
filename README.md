# Watch-Me

A responsive movie application developed with React.js and Node.js, while focusing on the frontend side.\
All of the data is fetched from a local JSON file and an external API called TMDB.\
Explore thousands of movies, watch trailers and make your very own favorites list!
* This project was made as part of an academic course.

* Note: After deploying the application to the web, the local JSON data wasn't visible, which means that\
  the Genre section doesn't load. Issue will be fixed in the future.
